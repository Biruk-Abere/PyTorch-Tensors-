# PyTorch-Tensors-
Fortunately, itâ€™s a lot easier to grasp what a "tensor" is in a practical sense and how we can manipulate them in data science but the real questions is what are Tensors really ? what does the name tensor tells us , what was their motivation for creating it ? This repository consists the history , motivation and manipulation of tensors. The Notebook consists #Creating Tensors #Random Tensors and Seeding #Tensor Shapes #Tensor Datatypes #Math and Logic With PyTorch Tensors #Tensor BroadCasting #More Math With Tensors #How to Compute Bitwise And , Bitwise Or , Bitwise Not of a given tensor in Pytorch #PyTorch Comparision #PyTorch Reductions #Copying A Tensor #Moving To GPU #Change The Number Of Dimensions #Accessing Dimensions Using Names #Type Promotions #Numpy Bridge
